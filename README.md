# Main Place Beauty Supply

**Description**  
This is a website I created for a beauty supply business called *Main Place Beauty Supply*. The website features products for hair care and accessories, with easy navigation between categories like **Hair Products**, **Hair**, and **Accessories**. Users can view detailed product descriptions, prices, ratings, and even sign up for updates on new products and special offers. This project was done as part of my **CST 2309 (Introduction to Web Programming)** class.

**Technologies Used**  
- HTML5
- CSS3 (for styling, including custom styles and external fonts from Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (for interactivity)
- Font Awesome (for icons like the search bar and social media links)

## Challenges Faced üõ†Ô∏è

When I started, I used the concepts I learned in class and from online tutorials. While working on this project, I encountered several challenges, particularly with centering elements and deciding how to structure both the homepage and products page. However, after spending a lot of time researching and rewriting my code, I was able to overcome these challenges. I also added features I hadn't originally planned on, such as the checkout page, and payment and shipping options.
